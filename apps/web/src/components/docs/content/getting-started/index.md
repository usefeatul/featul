Featul helps you collect user feedback, prioritize feature requests, and share product updates—all in one place.

## 1. Create a Free Account

Sign up with [Google](/auth/sign-up), [GitHub](/auth/sign-up), or [email](/auth/sign-up). If you use email, verify your account with the code sent to your inbox.

## 2. Create Your Workspace

Enter a workspace name and choose a subdomain (e.g., `yourproduct.featul.com`). This sets up your feedback portal.

## 3. Set Up Your First Board

Go to **Settings → Boards** and create a public feedback board. This is where customers submit ideas and vote on features.

## 4. Share with Customers

Share your workspace URL (`yourworkspace.featul.com`) with customers to start collecting feedback.
